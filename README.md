# AI-Disc-Scheduling
A)	
Overview:
Disk scheduling is key to maximizing the performance of the storage system through reduced seek time and efficient access to data. Conventional disk I/O request management algorithms such as FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, and C-SCAN are inflexible in handling dynamic environments. To overcome this, AI is proposed, where machine learning and optimization techniques improve the efficiency of scheduling. AI-based methods in this project encompass Reinforcement Learning, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, and Heuristic Optimization to optimize disk scheduling performance.

Objectives:
â€¢	To implement AI-driven disk scheduling techniques that minimize seek time and improve performance.
â€¢	To compare and contrast traditional and AI-based scheduling approaches.
â€¢	To analyze the efficiency of different AI techniques in optimizing disk scheduling.
â€¢	To visualize the execution order of disk requests to better understand the efficiency of each approach.
â€¢	To explore the adaptability of AI techniques to different request patterns.

Outcomes:
â€¢	Reduced Disk Seek Time: AI algorithms minimize head movement by optimizing disk I/O requests, speeding up data access.
â€¢	Improved I/O Throughput: Efficient scheduling increases the number of I/O operations completed per unit of time.
â€¢	Dynamic Adaptation: AI techniques adjust in real-time to changing workloads and access patterns for greater flexibility.
â€¢	Optimized Resource Utilization: AI methods like reinforcement learning improve disk resource management and efficiency.
â€¢	Comparative Analysis: The project will compare traditional and AI-based algorithms, highlighting their advantages and trade-offs.
â€¢	Scalability and Versatility: AI-enhanced algorithms scale across storage environments and adapt to various disk access patterns.

Problem Statement: 
Disk scheduling in traditional operating systems relies on algorithms like FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, and C-SCAN, which, while effective in basic scenarios, struggle to adapt to dynamic workloads and fail to optimize disk I/O efficiency in complex environments. These algorithms are deterministic and lack the flexibility to adjust in real-time based on varying access patterns, leading to increased seek times, reduced throughput, and inefficient resource utilization.
This project aims to address these limitations by implementing AI-based disk scheduling algorithms, including Reinforcement Learning, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, and Heuristic Optimization. These AI-driven approaches will optimize the order of disk I/O requests, dynamically adapt to workload changes, and improve overall system performance. The project will compare the efficiency of AI-based techniques with traditional scheduling methods, evaluating key metrics such as seek time, throughput, and resource utilization to demonstrate the potential benefits of AI in disk scheduling.


C)	Methodologies:
We implemented four AI-based approaches to disk scheduling. Each method was designed to dynamically optimize the movement of the disk head and minimize the seek time. The key methodologies used are as follows:

C.1. Reinforcement Learning-Based Disk Scheduling
Method: 
â€¢	Implemented Q-learning, a reinforcement learning technique where the disk head learns an optimal movement pattern through trial and error.
â€¢	The system states represent the current head position, while actions correspond to choosing a disk request.
â€¢	A Q-table was used to store learned values, which are updated based on the seek time minimization principle.
â€¢	The Q-learning model gradually improved as it learned to select the next request with minimal seek time.
Results:
â€¢	The reinforcement learning model successfully optimized the scheduling order.
â€¢	It dynamically adapted to request patterns and minimized unnecessary movements.
â€¢	The system demonstrated intelligent decision-making, improving performance over time.
 
C.2. Genetic Algorithm-Based Disk Scheduling
Method:
â€¢	Implemented evolutionary strategies inspired by natural selection.
â€¢	Generated a population of random request sequences and applied genetic operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve optimal schedules.
â€¢	The fitness function was designed to minimize total seek time.
â€¢	Over successive generations, the algorithm evolved increasingly optimized scheduling orders.
Results: 
â€¢	The genetic algorithm successfully found an optimized order for disk scheduling.
â€¢	The solution improved with each iteration, reducing the seek time progressively.
â€¢	This approach worked well for large and complex scheduling scenarios.
 
C.3. Neural Network-Based Disk Scheduling
Method:
â€¢	Used a feedforward neural network trained on synthetic disk request data.
â€¢	The model was trained with input features like the current disk position, upcoming requests, and their distances.
â€¢	The neural network learned to predict the next best request dynamically.
â€¢	The trained model could generalize to new request patterns and optimize scheduling on-the-fly.
Results:
â€¢	The neural network effectively predicted and scheduled disk requests.
â€¢	The model adapted well to different workloads and dynamically adjusted the scheduling order.
This AI-based method proved to be an effective data-driven solution for disk scheduling.
 
C.4. Heuristic-Based Disc Scheduling (Optimized SSTF)
Method:
â€¢	Implemented an optimized Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF) algorithm.
â€¢	The heuristic dynamically selected the nearest request at each step to minimize seek time.
â€¢	The method was optimized to avoid redundant loops and handle edge cases efficiently.
Results:
â€¢	The heuristic approach successfully minimized seek time.
â€¢	It provided a simple yet effective scheduling strategy.
â€¢	While less adaptable than AI-based methods, it offered a strong baseline for comparison.

â€¢	Genetic algorithms introduced an evolutionary strategy to refine disk scheduling for complex scenarios.
â€¢	Neural networks demonstrated predictive capabilities that allowed real-time decision-making for optimal request ordering.
â€¢	Heuristic-based scheduling (SSTF), while not as adaptive, still provided a strong and efficient baseline.
Overall, AI-driven disk scheduling methods proved to be more efficient, adaptive, and intelligent compared to traditional approaches. The integration of AI in disk scheduling has the potential to enhance the efficiency of modern storage systems, particularly in high-demand environments.

Future Scope:
â€¢	Enhancing AI models with real-time learning capabilities to allow continuous adaptation to evolving request patterns.
